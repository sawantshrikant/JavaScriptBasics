promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations. 
They represent a value that may not be available yet but will be resolved in the future, either successfully (resolved) or unsuccessfully (rejected).
 Promises provide a cleaner and more organized way to work with asynchronous code compared to callbacks.
 making it easier to work with code that doesn't necessarily execute sequentially.
  Promises have three possible states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected.
