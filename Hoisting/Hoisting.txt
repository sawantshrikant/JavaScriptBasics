 during the compilation phase, before the code is executed. 
 
priority queue
 A priority queue is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, each of which has an associated priority.
  The primary purpose of a priority queue is to efficiently retrieve and remove elements from the collection in order of their priority.
   Elements with higher priority should be removed and processed before elements with lower priority.
