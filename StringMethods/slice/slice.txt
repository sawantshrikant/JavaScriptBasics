slice() extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string.
The method takes 2 parameters: start position, and end position (end not included). 



substr(start, length)

substr extracts a specified number of characters from a string and returns them as a new string.
It takes two parameters: start and length.
start specifies where the extraction begins (inclusive), and length specifies how many characters to extract.
If length is omitted, it extracts from the starting position to the end of the string.

substring(start, end):

substring is similar to slice but does not accept negative indices.
It takes two parameters: start and end.
start specifies where the extraction begins (inclusive), and end specifies where it ends (exclusive).
If end is omitted, it continues to the end of the string.
