used to remove whitespace (spaces, tabs, and newline characters) from both the beginning and end of a string.
 It does not modify the original string but instead returns a new string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.


 The trimStart() method works like trim(), but removes whitespace only from the start of a string.

 The trimEnd() method works like trim(), but removes whitespace only from the end of a string.
