*Modules -

 more modular, maintainable, and reusable.
 ES6 introduced a module system, allowing you to import and export functions,
  variables, and objects between different JavaScript files.

 *Default parameters
 Default parameters are a feature introduced that allow you to assign default values to function parameters
  if no value or undefined is passed when the function is called.

*Template strings
  allow you to create multi-line strings and embed expressions directly inside string literals.
   They use backticks (`) to define the string, and placeholders ${expression} for embedding variables or expressions within the string.

    allows you to extract values from objects and arrays into individual variables.
    This feature provides a convenient way to work with data in a more concise and expressive manner.
